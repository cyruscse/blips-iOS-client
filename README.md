# blips-iOS-client
## Written by Cyrus Sadeghi

Fourth year Carleton SYSC (Software) project. Written using Swift.

About half of the code is commented (I didn't have time to document all the code as we were running out of time towards the end of the year),
but the code should be relatively simple to understand. It is written against the iOS 11 API using Swift 4 and may not work with newer versions of
the iOS API or Swift.

Since our fourth year project has been completed, we have shut down the server (which was hosted on AWS, check the blips-server repo for details).
The client is therefore not functional, but if the server is hosted again on AWS (or another provider), the client can work again if it is pointed
to the new server URL.
